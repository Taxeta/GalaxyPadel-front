            -GALAXY PADEL MOBILE WEB APP -

Welcome to GalaxyPadel mobile web App. This website has been built with the intention of sharing information about padel rackets and being able to add a rating about their use.

The web application is a CRUD where users can perform the following functions:

- It is a complete website where users can create paddle rackets once registered with GitHub.

- Obtain the rackets associated with that user (in this case the blades created by himself).

- Delete the rackets that the user does not want to have in their account.

- Add to favorites the padel rackets that the user loves.

Future updates of this mobile website are also pending...
