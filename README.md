Welcome to GalaxyPadel mobile web App. This website has been built with the intention of sharing information about padel rackets and being able to add a rating about their use.

The application stack is currently Typescript, with the react library, Firebase SDK as authentication with gitHub, Eslint, Prettier, Sonar for testing validation, React-Router-Dom for routing, Redux-Toolkit, Vitest and Node js.

The web application is a CRUD where users can perform the following functions:

:white_check_mark: It is a complete website where users can create paddle rackets once registered with GitHub.

:white_check_mark: Obtain the rackets associated with that user (in this case the blades created by himself).

:white_check_mark: Delete the rackets that the user does not want to have in their account.

:white_check_mark: Add to favorites the padel rackets that the user loves.

:fast_forward: Future updates of this mobile website are also pending...
